### Correlation matrix info

Only significant correlations are presented - if a square is missing (aside 
from the diagonal), it is because there is not a significant correlation between
the two variables given the significance level selected. 

The value shown in the square is the correlation coefficient value for any
significant correlations.   

You can select the type of variables to include in
the correlation matrix as well as the significance level to use as the cutoff 
to show correlations.
