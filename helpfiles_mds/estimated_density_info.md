### Estimated density plot info

A density plot visualizes the distribution of data over a continuous interval 
or time period. This chart is a variation of a histogram that uses kernel 
smoothing to plot values, allowing for smoother distributions by smoothing out 
the noise. The peaks of a density plots help display where values are 
concentrated over the interval. An advantage density plots have over histograms 
is that they're better at determining the distribution shape because they're 
not affected by the number of bins used (each bar used in a typical histogram).
