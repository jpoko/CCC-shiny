## Orientation      

### Data collected     

When individuals applied to participate in the study, they were asked to provide
their sexual orientation by selecting from a list of options. They were able 
to select all that applied as well provide their own description.   

**Question prompt:** How would you describe your sexual orientation? (choose all
that apply)   

**Response options (check box, select all that apply):**    

- Heterosexual  
- Lesbian  
- Gay  
- Bisexual  
- Queer  
- Intersex  
- Pansexual  
- Asexual  
- Questioning/unsure  
- Prefer to self-describe: (fill in response)  
- Prefer not to say  




### Data processing  

The number of possible orientation combinations that people selected ranged from
27 (participants who started the study) to 40 (all applicants). Some of these 
combinations only had 1 individual who provided that particular combination. 
For analysis purposes, it was necessary to reduce the number of possible
orientation categories. We decided on 3 orientation categories:   

- Heterosexual  
- LGBQA  
- Prefer not to say  

Each combination was placed into one of these 3 categories.   


***Rules for categorization:***    

- If only 'Heterosexual' was selected - categorized as 'Heterosexual'    
- If only 'prefer not to say' - categorized as 'prefer not to say'  
- If 'prefer to self-describe' was selected with no additional 
description provided - categorized as 'prefer not to say'   
- All other responses were categorized as 'LGBQA' (lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer,
asexual).     



Please see the sankey diagram ('Visualization' tab above) to see exactly how the 
responses were categorized into our 3 orientation categories.     

### Final categories
