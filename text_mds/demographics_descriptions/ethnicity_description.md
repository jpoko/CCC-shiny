### Data processing  

The number of possible ethnicity combinations that people selected ranged from
48 (participants who started the study) to 70 (all applicants). Some of these 
combinations only had 1 individual who provided that particular combination. 
For analysis purposes, it was necessary to reduce the number of possible
categories. We decided on 12 ethnicity categories:   

- Asian                                                
- Asian and White                                    
- Black, African American or Afro-Caribbean          
- Black, African American or Afro Caribbean and White  
- Hispanic or Latino                                 
- Hispanic or Latino and White                       
- Indigenous                                         
- Indigenous and White                               
- Multi-ethnic                                       
- Pacific Islander                                   
- Prefer not to say                                  
- White     

Each response was placed into one of these 12 categories.
