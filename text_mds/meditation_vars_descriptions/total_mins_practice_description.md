**Meditation variable description:** At each assessment,
participants were asked "How long have you been practicing per session/sit 
(on average)?" with two inputs ('hours' and 'minutes') where they could 
fill in their response. This information was converted to a 'total minutes per 
sit' value, reflecting how long, on average, they meditated per sit/session. 

Details:  

1) if hours > 3 - response was made NA   
2) if minutes > 180 (equivalent to 3 hours) - response was made NA  
3) hours was converted to minutes (hours * 60 = hour minutes)   
4) hour minutes was added to minutes for total minutes per sit
